Project Definition of Done (DoD) Documentation

GCP Cloud Engineering Team
Purpose
This document outlines the current and proposed "Definition of Done" (DoD) criteria for projects managed by the Cloud Engineering team.

Current Process – Project Definition of Done
Project Workflow Overview
Project Request Submission
The Application Team submits a new project request to the Enterprise Intakes Team.
The Intakes Team reviews the project architecture and prepares an estimated cost for approval by the App Team management.
Cloud Engineering Resource Allocation
Upon management approval, the Cloud Engineering team is requested to allocate resources.
Hours are allocated based on estimates, typically covering the project’s deployment duration, which may span several months. For example, an engineer may be allocated 5 hours weekly.
Infrastructure Setup
The assigned Cloud Engineer creates the landing zone (GCP project), unless an existing GCP project is available.
Required network configurations and tags are set up.
Support and Handoff
The engineer provides ongoing support to the Application team, including guidance on project access, troubleshooting, and responding to ad-hoc requests.
The engineer attends meetings as necessary and acts as the primary Cloud Engineering point of contact.
Once the production environment is fully set up or the allocated ITPR hours have expired, the Cloud Engineer’s support concludes.
Definition of Done
The Cloud Engineer has completed the setup of the required environments.
The Application team has received the necessary guidance.
Ongoing support responsibilities end when the project reaches production or allocated hours are expended.

Proposed Process – Project Definition of Done
Project Workflow Overview
Project Request Submission and Cloud Engineering Assignment
Following request submission and architectural review by the Intakes Team, Cloud Engineering resources are assigned, and ITPR hours allocated.
Landing Zone and Environment Setup
The assigned Cloud Engineer creates a landing zone (GCP project) for all necessary environments (dev, qa, prod, etc.).
Required infrastructure including network, and tags are delivered.
Project Handoff and Support Transition
Once setup is complete, the Cloud Engineer provides all necessary guidance to the Application team for access request processes.
Definition of Done is met once the infrastructure is established, and the handoff guidance has been provided.
Post-DoD Support
After the project handoff, the Application team will engage the Operations Team for ongoing support, troubleshooting, or additional requirements.
Definition of Done for Proposed Process
The Cloud Engineer has set up the landing zone (GCP project) and all required environments.
All requested infrastructure, subnets, tags etc. have been provided.
Guidance has been provided to the Application team for the project IAM request process for configuration and deployments.
Cloud Engineering involvement concludes upon handoff, with any further support routed to the Cloud Operations Team.
