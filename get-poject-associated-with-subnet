The Cloud Security IAM team is responsible for managing IAM. Below is the process for submitting an IAM request. This process is concise and straightforward; however, it is important to conduct research beforehand to identify the specific IAM roles required for your task. Detailed information on IAM roles and permissions can be found in the Google Cloud IAM documentation.

For further inquiries regarding the IAM request process, please contact the Security team at security@sec.com.

In the event of a production emergency requiring immediate group access, it is recommended to contact the JJQ helpdesk at 222-222-2222 or the JPQ helpdesk at 333-333-3333. When contacting the helpdesk, ensure that you provide the correct cloud provider, details of the issue, and the type of team required for the call.
